# Nha Trang Cafe Website
A static website created for a small local restaurant.
The restaurant's main requirement was to create a web presence to give customers a way to view their food menu online.
Through this experience, I was able to learn and practice photography skills by capturing photos of the restaurant and it's food in-person.
